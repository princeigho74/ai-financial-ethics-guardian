## 🎯 Problem Statement

Financial institutions increasingly rely on AI for critical decisions like credit scoring, loan approvals, and fraud detection. However, these systems can perpetuate bias and lack transparency, leading to:
- Discriminatory lending practices
- Regulatory violations (EU AI Act, Fair Lending Laws, GDPR)
- Loss of consumer trust
- Financial and reputational damage

**AI Financial Ethics Guardian** addresses these challenges by providing real-time monitoring, bias detection, and compliance tracking.
